An open-source Gen1 Haldex Controller which originates/is a fork from ABangingDonk's OpenHaldex T4.  

The controller allows for 3 main modes: stock, FWD and a 100% lockup at the Haldex and it only supports Gen1 at this stage.
The forked code has been tweaked to support the remote screen, standalone modes (so conversations/swaps into non-CANBUS).

For boards/units ordered through Forbes Automotive, the firmware can be updated by using the latest "V" marked folder to download the Hex file and upload directly to the Teensy4.0 with a Micro-USB cable.  It is recommended to check back here regularly to find updates.

For users wishing to customise or edit the code, it is released here for free use.
