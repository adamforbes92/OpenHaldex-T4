/*
Section dedicated ENTIRELY for version tracking(!)

V1.09 - Initial release, poor version tracking until now.  Basic code + Gen1 major support
V1.10 - dialled in Gen2; working on the bench.  Has change in range (0-255?), mostly controlled by Bremse
      - added flashing red LED for no CANBUS comms.  Added standalone but allow diagnostic data through - so Haldex can be diagnosed with VCDS etc
